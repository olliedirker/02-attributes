      <p>I have always been interested in technology and am passionate about the things I enjoy. I love traveling, spending time with my almost five year old daughter and girlfriend of nine years. I also very much enjoy reading, I will read anything that is good but mostly i delve into fantasy books. Recently my family and I bought a house and so we are doing lots of work on that. I also hope to one day soon be working for a company I am proud to be a part of.</p>
